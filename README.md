Personal customization for Linux distros

Until I find a better way to do this simply clone the repo and manually replace the files in ~/

[TODO]

Make it so I can easily check what 'scripts' I have installed

Make it so that strippystrip tells you how much space you saved

Add auto install, remove git repo by going into parent, and prompting for override for all config files

Add a message that shows alias and greets user with script version
